Urwashi C (11/25/2020, 6:51:43 PM): Hi! My name is Urwashi. Give me a few seconds to pull up your account info 
Urwashi C (11/25/2020, 6:52:03 PM): In order for me to help you with the best resolution, may I know your concern? 
Me (11/25/2020, 6:53:14 PM): Hello Urwashi, I have an order that had an ETA of 6:41. I was wondering if it is still being prepared or if the dasher missed the delivery? 
Urwashi C (11/25/2020, 6:53:23 PM): One moment please, while I check your order status. 
Urwashi C (11/25/2020, 6:53:49 PM): I checked my system and can see that the restaurant has confirmed your order but it is running late. We could be having trouble finding a Dasher or the restaurant is delayed preparing your food. 
Urwashi C (11/25/2020, 6:54:20 PM): Nathan, The dasher has been assigned with the  order, and soon he will arrive to pick up 
Urwashi C (11/25/2020, 6:54:33 PM): I'm sorry about the trouble and I know this won't make up for the delay but let me also give you DoorDash credits for your time. 
Urwashi C (11/25/2020, 6:55:36 PM): i have processed a total of $5.00 credits and sent a confirmation email to you 
Urwashi C (11/25/2020, 6:55:41 PM): Hope this helps? 
Me (11/25/2020, 6:56:05 PM): I appreciate it, but $10 would have been better honestly. 
Urwashi C (11/25/2020, 6:56:51 PM): I wish i could do that for you 
Urwashi C (11/25/2020, 6:57:09 PM): I am so sorry about that
